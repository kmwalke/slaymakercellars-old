<h1 id="story">Our Story</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Slaymaker Cellars</strong> is a local, high quality Meadery located in Idaho Springs, Colorado. We are
  dedicated to using high quality ingredients, making high quality wine, and giving back to the community.
</p>

<%= image_tag "carboys.jpg", align: "left", class: "home_image_left" %>

<p>
  We are currently in our Research and Development mode. Our head meadmaker, Kent Slaymaker, has been making mead
  for over ten years. Now we are switching over to a professional winery set up.
</p>

<h1>What is Mead?</h1>
<p>
  Mead is "Honey Wine". We work with local apiaries (Bee farms) to source high quality honey. We use traditional
  winemaking techniques to ferment that honey into mead.
</p>

<p>
  Mead may be the oldest fermented beverage know to humans, it was popular from 12,000 years ago all the way up to
  the renaissance, when beer and grape wine took over as the most popular drinks.
</p>

<p>
  In the modern day, mead has been seeing a bit of a resurgence.
</p>

<h1>How do you get some of our mead?</h1>
<p>
  We are not yet selling our mead as we are refining our recipes and finishing up our permitting process.
  Look for us at upcoming festivals and events in the Clear Creek County area.
